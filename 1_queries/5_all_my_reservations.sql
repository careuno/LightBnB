Show all reservations for a user.

Select all columns from the reservations table, all columns from the properties table, and the average rating of the property.
The reservations will be for a single user, so use 1 for the user_id.
Order the results from the earliest start_date to the most recent start_date.
These will end up being filtered by either "Upcoming Reservations" or "Past Reservations", so only get reservations where the end_date is in the past.
Use now()::date to get today's date.
Limit the results to 10.
